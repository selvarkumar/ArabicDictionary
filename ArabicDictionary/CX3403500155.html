 <div id="document-header"><h1><span class="citation-title">FATIMA (C. 605-633) </span></h1></div>
 <div class="SideNotePara"><p>Fatima (d. 633) was the daughter of the prophet Muhammad and Khadija, spouse of Muhammad's cousin and companion ??Ali b. Abi Talib, and mother of al-Hasan and al-Husayn, the Prophet's only male descendants. ??Ali headed the line of the Shi??ite imams. Fatima's genealogical position reveals the significance attributed to her throughout the <span class="ArabicDictionaryTerm" style="background-color: #FFFF00" title="Muslim    (Ar., mus-lim)&#10;     A follower of Islam.&#10;">Muslim</span> world and explains the veneration she enjoys. </p></div>
 <div class="SideNotePara"><p>Fatima is said to be the source of blessing ( <i><span class="ArabicDictionaryTerm" style="background-color: #FFFF00" title="Baraka    (Ar., bah-rah-kah)&#10;     Blessings of God.&#10;">baraka</span> </i>), and is a saint, particularly the patron saint of fertility, and is appealed to as a mediator between God and humans. Her blessing hand is commonly used to protect against the evil eye. </p></div>
 <div class="SideNotePara"><p>Little is known about the actual figure hidden behind a blooming legend that combines the historical with fictional and mystical elements. Early Islamic literature such as the Prophet's biography, historiography, <span class="ArabicDictionaryTerm" style="background-color: #FFFF00" title="Hadith    (Ar., ha-deeth, pl., ahadith a-ha-deeth)&#10;     The utterances, opinions, or rulings of the prophet Muhammad. According to the methods through which they have been collected and verified in the three centuries following his death, two elements are essential to a reliable hadith: a continuous, verifiable isnad (chain of transmitters), and a correspondence (or absence of contradiction to) the Quran. The Hadith, along with the Sunna and the Quran are the main sources for Islamic law. Sunnis and Shiites share many ahadith, but have different isnads.&#10;">hadith</span> collections, and exegetical literature do not provide a comprehensive biography of Fatima. However, they present some genealogical and biographical cornerstones and occasional events of her life. The date of her birth remains uncertain as well as the date of her marriage to ??Ali b. Abi Talib (622 or 623). Her son Hasan was born in 624 and Husayn in 626. She also gave birth to two daughters, Umm Kulthum and Zaynab. The authors agree with regard to the year in which she died, although there is no clear reference to the month, that is, the exact period of time after her father's death. Furthermore, we find contradictory indications concerning the circumstances of her last hours, her burial at night, and the location of her tomb. Only few records deal with historical events she was involved in. </p></div>
 <div class="SideNotePara"><p>The legend woven about Fatima provides further insights as to her importance as a spiritual personality, both for <span class="ArabicDictionaryTerm" style="background-color: #FFFF00" title="Sunni    (Ar., sun-nee)&#10;     The largest group of Muslim adherents, the Sunni emphasize the Sunna (actions of Muhammad), the hadith (sayings of the Prophet) and the Quran.

Hagiographical literature is manifold and portrays the Prophet's daughter as a multifaceted personality, appearing in Shi??ite texts as early as the tenth century. </p></div>
 <div class="SideNotePara"><p>The Fatima of the legend is given numerous epithets as al-Zahra?? (the Shining one), the Resplendent, or the supreme Mary; they all indicate that she represents the female ideal of Islam. </p></div>

celestial being working miracles on the other. Her closeness to the Prophet and the imams is expressed by her belonging to the people of the Prophet's house, to the five people of the mantle, to the immaculates, and to the people of the ordeal. </p></div>
 <div class="SideNotePara"><p>Fatima's first biographers were two European scholars, Henri Lammens and Louis Massignon. Their portraits of the Prophet's daughter stood in striking contradiction to each other. Whereas Lammens's Fatima is unattractive, of mediocre intelligence, and lacking in significance, Massignon depicts an almost mystical and sublime personality with a religious significance akin to that of the Virgin Mary. Laura Veccia Valieri's comprehensive study tries to emphasize the fact that historical reality ranges between the two portraits. Since historical sources are few and sometimes even contradictory, the conflict in historical apprehension continues. Hagiographical models in the earlier Islamic literature show???even in historical literature???that making a clear distinction between the real person and the legend can be quite difficult. </p></div>
 <div class="SideNotePara"><p>In the course of the Islamic revolution of Iran the legend of Fatima enjoyed a considerable renaissance and actualization as the female role model. She symbolized the committed fighter, engaged for the <span class="ArabicDictionaryTerm" style="background-color: #FFFF00" title="Muslim    (Ar., mus-lim)&#10;     A follower of Islam.&#10;">Muslim</span> community and thus became the model in opposition to the Western woman pursuing only her individual emancipation. </p></div>
